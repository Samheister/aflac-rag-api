“We already offer good benefits.”:
Aflac complements what you already offer. It pays employees directly when they’re out of work — that’s what makes it different.

“Our employees wouldn’t be interested.”:
Most employees love having options. This isn’t another health plan — this is cash in their hands when life hits hard.

Zero cost to the employer. In fact, most businesses save money from FICA reductions.

“This sounds complicated.”:
Setup is handled by Aflac."
